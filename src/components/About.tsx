          Iâ€™m a results-driven Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience
          building backend-heavy full-stack applications using Python,
          JavaScript, Django, FastAPI, and React. I enjoy designing and
          deploying scalable APIs and tools with cloud services like AWS, CI/CD
          automation, and clean system architecture. My work spans startups and
          agile teams where I thrive on solving technical challenges with
          performance and reliability in mind.
